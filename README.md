### Do not read books or subtitles if you do not understand foreign speech by ear

Books, subtitles are spoken language converted from the human auditory system to the human visual system. It's roughly like converting smells and tastes into text: "Banana is potato and sugar." Written language is for the transfer of information, but makes learning foreign languages absolutely impossible. Compare the size of a one-minute dialog as a video file, an audio file, and a text file. Is the difference between them thousands of times unnecessary information? 

For example, the phrase "What are you doing today?" is only spelled that way. And if you change even one letter, it's a mistake. In spoken language, this phrase has thousands of variants, depending on the speaker: geography, age, stuttering, angina, accent, dialect, foul and parasitic words.
