### Do not read books or subtitles if you do not understand foreign language by ear

Books, subtitles are spoken language converted from the human auditory system to the human visual system. It's like converting smells and tastes into text: "Banana is potato and sugar." Written language is good for transmitting information quickly, but learning foreign languages is impossible. Compare the size of a one-minute dialog that is packaged as a video file, an audio file, and a text file. Is the difference between them thousands of times unnecessary information? 

For example, the phrase "What are you doing today?" is only spelled that way. And if you change even one letter, it's a mistake. In spoken language, this phrase has thousands of variants, depending on the speaker: geography, age, stuttering, accent, dialect, foul and parasitic words.

Linguistics cuts infinite spoken language to a small number of words, rules and grammatical rules. At the same time, linguistics complicates written language. For example, the spelling of almost all words is different from spoken language. What is a hieroglyph? A hieroglyph is when the spelling of a word and its transcription are different. And it turns out that all the languages of the world are hieroglyphic languages, like Chinese. How is it possible to learn a foreign language this way? 

For example, you can read the letter "A" as "B", the letter "B" as "274", the letter "C" as "å­—" and so on, but this will not prevent you from reading foreign books in the original in six months! That is, you can read foreign letters as you like. In this way you create your own version of a foreign language. And if you want to talk to a native speaker, you will not understand each other. This happens if you learn a foreign language from textbooks that describe the sounds and letters of the foreign language.

Are you able to mentally pump your muscles? Why do you think you can pump up listening comprehension (movement of the eardrums) and speaking (movement of the lips and tongue). 

"Real Foreign Language" is a spoken language and a video. If you don't see the context, you don't know exactly what is going on. You are supposed to guess from the book, but the book is a small part of what is happening. This causes the problem of what translation to choose for a foreign word from a dictionary.

If you learn a foreign language with the help of movies, TV series with original subtitles, you are actually learning two different foreign languages at the same time - written language and spoken language. And because the human visual system is ten times more powerful than the human auditory system, you memorise the foreign word as a picture of letters, and the audio word is suppressed by this picture. So it is very easy to learn to read, and impossible to learn to understand movies.


### When a foreign language starts to develop on its own

The main idea of my method is to quickly reach the level of listening comprehension of TV channels (here is the maximum speed of speech), understanding the general meaning of dialogues, without understanding details. You will not just learn a foreign language, but you will become a native speaker of that foreign language. At this level, the foreign language is maintained and developed independently without your efforts. And your goal is to reach this level. Otherwise, learning a foreign language will take forever. 

After enlightenment, the next goal is to watch as many serials, movies, TV shows as possible in each day, trying to understand the details of foreign speech. After six months, you will understand up to 90 percent of the dialogues.  Learning the other 10 per cent of the foreign language will take a few more years. Once you understand foreign TV channels by ear, it is easy to learn to read, write and speak a foreign language.

### Every word has its own speed

The most difficult part of learning a foreign language is the vocabulary. Foreign words that you have tried to memorise many times, you still forget after a while. The reason is very simple, your brain forgets everything. And your mother tongue is also forgotten over time, but because you constantly speak, listen and think in your mother tongue, it seems to you that your mother tongue is forever. The slower a juggler moves his hands, the fewer balls he can toss. That is, the less you speak and think in your mother tongue, the smaller your vocabulary. It is impossible to memorise a foreign word on the first try! Each attempt to memorise a foreign word (5-30 seconds) or recognising a foreign word in movies or texts (less than a second) increases the "storage time" of the word in your memory.
