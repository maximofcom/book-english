### Do not read books or subtitles if you do not understand foreign language by ear

Books, subtitles are spoken language converted from the human auditory system to the human visual system. It's like converting smells and tastes into text: "Banana is potato and sugar." Written language is good for transmitting information quickly, but learning foreign languages is impossible. Compare the size of a one-minute dialog that is packaged as a video file, an audio file, and a text file. Is the difference between them thousands of times unnecessary information? 

For example, the phrase "What are you doing today?" is only spelled that way. And if you change even one letter, it's a mistake. In spoken language, this phrase has thousands of variants, depending on the speaker: geography, age, stuttering, accent, dialect, foul and parasitic words.

Linguistics cuts infinite spoken language to a small number of words, rules and grammatical rules. At the same time, linguistics complicates written language. For example, the spelling of almost all words is different from spoken language. What is a hieroglyph? A hieroglyph is when the spelling of a word and its transcription are different. And it turns out that all the languages of the world are hieroglyphic languages, like Chinese. How is it possible to learn a foreign language this way?
